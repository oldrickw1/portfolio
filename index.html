                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I’m a software developer with a love for business logic and backend programming. Ever since the first introductory course I was hooked. It’s a great and enjoyable combination between problem solving and creating something that can help others.
                My preferred languages are Java and C# for their robustness, but I also have ample experience in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin and C. </p>

            <h1>Vocabulary builder</h1>
            <p>Android app writtin in Java and Kotlin since most of the info available about the used libraries was written in the latter. In this project, I combined my love for languages with programming and made a tool that I was missing. A vocabulary builder that stores the words of your personal vocabulary in a given language that helps you to detect new words and helps you practice them. It uses a google library < name here > that let’s you scan word from your phone, and the logic determines the words that are still unknown to you. This way, a reader can scan a page of a book, practice all the words he or she doesn’t know, and then read the page without having to interrupt the reading to look the word up each time. Still under development</p>

            <h1>Weather app</h1>
            <p>Android app that uses REST-API calls to collect weather information and visualizes the data in a nice graph for the next 7 days. This app was made primarily	to practice more with REST-API’s, data extraction and data visualization. Once again MPAndroidChart was used as the visualization library. 
                Written in Java.

            <h1>Time Tracker</h1>
            <p>This Android app, written in Java, was written both to practice with mobile development, as well as for personal use to track the time I actually spend on programming. It has a simple and easy to use UI, which let’s the user track the time spend on a given activity. The data is stored in a Sqlite3 database, and is visualized in a bar chart that’s made with MPAndroidChart. </p>

            <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
            <p>I made this GUI application with Java to get a better feeling for software design and MVC in particular. Earlier, I made an attempt to implement chess but since it’s a more complex game, I opted to use Tic Tac Toe since I could concentrate more on the architecture. JFrame/Swing was used for the GUI.

            <h1>Selenium Web Scraper</h1>
            <p>I had been asked to contact candidates for a certain position, but the portal I had to work with had limited options for filtering etc., so a webscraper was made with Python to collect the data. Initially the Beautiful Soup library was used, but after I encountered some access issues, Selenium seemed to be the better option. The data was collected, filtered, and some automation was used for sending out emails.

            <p>As part of my thesis, I developed a tool to calculate the optimal way to cut wooden boards for a given list of dimensions and quality categories. This problem, which is a variation of the classic Knapsack Problem, was solved with Dynamic Programming. The program was written in Python and Tkinter was used as a GUI tool to visualize the results. </p>

            <p>First web application I made as part of the final project of the Harvard MOOC “CS50 | Introduction to Computer Science”. Python with Flask was used for the back-end, and the front-end was done with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS. The data persistence was carried out with sqlite3 to write to local storage. The “real-time” chat feature was implemented with AJAX. 
                Unfortunately, the source code got lost.
